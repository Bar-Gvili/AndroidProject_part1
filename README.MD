Project: Lane Dodger - Android Course Part 1
Course Context
Welcome! This project represents Part 1 of an Android App Development course. It serves as a foundational exercise focusing on core game mechanics, user input, and basic game state management within the Android framework.

Game Description üöóüí®
Lane Dodger is a mobile game where the player controls a car moving along a five-lane road. The objective is to dodge incoming obstacles by switching lanes while trying to collect coins.

Gameplay:

The player's car moves continuously forward.
Players can use on-screen buttons or the phone's accelerometer to move the car between the five available lanes.
Obstacles and coins appear randomly in the lanes and move toward the player.
The game ends when the player runs out of lives after colliding with obstacles.
The game features a high-score table that saves the score along with the geographical location where the game was played.
Current Features ‚ú®
Life System: The game ends after a fixed number of collisions with obstacles.
Two Control Modes: Players can choose between button-based controls or motion sensor (accelerometer) controls for gameplay.
Obstacle and Coin Spawning: Obstacles and collectible coins appear randomly in the lanes.
Collision Detection: The game detects when the player's car hits an obstacle or a coin.
Scoring System with Location: The game includes a scoring system. Each final score is saved with the device's current location to be displayed on the leaderboard.
Leaderboard with Map Integration: A high-score screen displays a list of top scores. Selecting a score will focus the map on the location where it was achieved.
Work In Progress (WIP) üöß
This is an early version, and many aspects are still under development, particularly the visual design. Items currently considered WIP include:

üé® Button Design: Colors, shapes, and styles of UI buttons.
üöó Car Image: Placeholder or basic graphic used for the player's car.
üß± Obstacle Images: Placeholder or basic graphics for obstacles.
üñºÔ∏è Background Image(s): The visual backdrop for the road and environment.
‚ú® General UI/UX: Overall look, feel, and user experience refinement.
Future parts of the course will likely build upon this foundation, adding features like improved graphics and sound
